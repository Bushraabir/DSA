Greedy Algorithm â€“ Job Sequencing Problem (Maximize Total Profit)

Intuition & Logic:
- Given jobs with deadlines and profits, each job takes exactly one day.
- Only one job can be scheduled per day.
- Goal: maximize total profit by scheduling jobs before their deadlines.
- Greedy choice:
    - Sort jobs by descending profit to prioritize high-profit jobs.
    - For each job, schedule it on the latest available day before its deadline.
    - Scheduling jobs as late as possible frees earlier days for other jobs with tighter deadlines.
- This approach ensures maximum total profit and maximum jobs done.

Problem Example:
Jobs (sorted by profit):
ID: J6, Profit: 80, Deadline: 2
ID: J3, Profit: 70, Deadline: 6
ID: J4, Profit: 65, Deadline: 6
ID: J2, Profit: 60, Deadline: 5
ID: J5, Profit: 25, Deadline: 4
ID: J8, Profit: 22, Deadline: 2
ID: J1, Profit: 20, Deadline: 4
ID: J7, Profit: 18, Deadline: 2

Schedule by placing each job in the latest free slot before its deadline:
- J6 on day 2
- J3 on day 6
- J4 on day 5
- J2 on day 4
- J5 on day 3
- J8 on day 1
- J1 on day 0 (if indexing from 0)
- J7 cannot be scheduled

Max profit = 342 with 7 jobs scheduled.

Algorithm:
- Sort jobs in descending order by profit.
- Find maxDeadline among jobs.
- Initialize schedule array (size maxDeadline+1) with -1 (indicating free day).
- For each job in sorted order:
    - Check from job.deadline down to day 1 for a free slot.
    - If free slot found, assign job and update total profit and count.
- Return total jobs scheduled and total profit.

TIME & SPACE COMPLEXITY:
- Time: O(N log N + N * maxDeadline), due to sorting and scheduling.
- Space: O(maxDeadline), for the schedule array.
