/*
 * Intuition:
 * ----------
 * Insertion Sort works like the way you sort playing cards in your hands.
 * - You start with the second element (index 1) assuming the first element is already sorted.
 * - You pick the current element (called 'key') and compare it with all the elements to its left.
 * - If an element is greater than 'key', you shift it one position to the right.
 * - You continue this until you find the correct position for the key.
 * - Insert the key at that position.
 * - Repeat this for all elements in the array.
 *
 * The left side of the array is always sorted, and you're expanding this sorted region one element at a time.

/*  
Selection Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.
It divides the array into two parts: the sorted part at the beginning, and the unsorted part at the end.
In every iteration, it selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and places it at the beginning of the unsorted part.

Working Principle:
- Start from the first element.
- Assume it as the minimum and compare with the rest of the array.
- Find the actual minimum element in the remaining unsorted part.
- Swap it with the first element of the unsorted part.
- Repeat the process for the rest of the array.

Time Complexity:
    - Best Case: O(N^2)
    - Average Case: O(N^2)
    - Worst Case: O(N^2)

Space Complexity:
    - O(1) (In-place sorting)

Stable Sort: No (Because equal elements may be swapped)
Adaptive: No (Performs the same regardless of the input)
