/*
 * Problem Statement: Dijkstra's Algorithm - Why Priority Queue / Set over Queue, Intuition, and Time Complexity
 *
 * You are given a weighted, directed graph with V vertices and E edges, represented
 * as an adjacency list. The goal is to find the shortest distance from a given source
 * node to all other nodes in the graph.
 *
 * Key Observations:
 * - Each edge has a non-negative weight.
 * - Using a standard queue (FIFO) might yield correct results but is inefficient.
 *   Redundant processing occurs when longer paths to the same node are explored.
 * - Priority Queue (Min-Heap) or Set ensures that nodes are processed in order of
 *   minimal distance, reducing unnecessary iterations.
 *
 * Intuition:
 * 1. Dijkstra's algorithm is greedy: it always chooses the unvisited node with the
 *    smallest known distance from the source.
 * 2. Once a node's minimal distance is finalized, it cannot be improved further.
 * 3. Using a priority queue or set guarantees that the next node processed is always
 *    the closest unvisited node, preventing redundant exploration of longer paths.
 *
 * Time Complexity Derivation (O(E log V)):
 * 1. Let V be the number of vertices and E be the number of edges.
 * 2. Each node is extracted from the priority queue at most once: O(V log V) for pops.
 * 3. For each edge, the potential distance update (push) into the priority queue costs O(log V).
 * 4. Total edge operations = O(E log V).
 * 5. Combining: O(V log V + E log V) â‰ˆ O(E log V) (dominant term).
 *
 * Limitations:
 * - Dijkstra's algorithm does NOT work correctly for graphs with negative edge weights
 *   or negative weight cycles.
 *
 * Space Complexity:
 * - O(V + E) for the adjacency list.
 * - O(V) for the distance array.
 * - O(V) for the priority queue or set.
