/*
 * Problem Statement: Distance of Nearest Cell having 1 in a 0/1 Matrix
 *
 * You are given a binary grid of size N x M containing only 0s and 1s.
 * Task: For each cell, find the distance to the nearest cell containing 1.
 *
 * Example Input:
 * grid = {
 *   {0, 0, 0},
 *   {0, 1, 0},
 *   {0, 0, 0}
 * }
 *
 * Key Observations:
 * - Distance is measured as Manhattan distance: |r1 - r2| + |c1 - c2|.
 * - BFS is ideal because it explores level by level, guaranteeing the minimum distance.
 * - Multi-source BFS can be used by starting from all cells containing 1.
 *
 * Intuition:
 * - Initialize a visited matrix of size N x M.
 * - Initialize a distance matrix of size N x M.
 * - Enqueue all cells containing 1 with distance 0 and mark them visited.
 * - Perform BFS:
 *   * For each dequeued cell (row, col, steps):
 *       - Set distance[row][col] = steps.
 *       - Explore four neighbors (up, right, down, left).
 *       - If a neighbor is valid and unvisited, mark it visited and enqueue with steps + 1.
 * - Return the distance matrix after BFS completes.
 *
 * Edge Cases:
 * - Grid may have multiple disconnected 0 regions.
 * - Cells already containing 1 â†’ distance 0.
 *
 * Time Complexity:
 * - O(N*M), since each cell is visited once and four neighbors are checked.
 *
 * Space Complexity:
 * - O(N*M) for visited matrix, distance matrix, and BFS queue in worst case.
