## 📂 Repo Structure
Organized for easy navigation:
- **`Patterns/`**: Fun exercises like printing triangles, pyramids, and diamond patterns.
- **`Arrays/`**: Array manipulation, searching, sorting, and problem-solving challenges.
- **`Others/`**: Coming soon: Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, and more!
- **File Naming**: Clear `.cpp` filenames, e.g., `star_pyramid.cpp`, for quick reference.
- **Language**: Modern C++ for performance and readability.

## 💻 Sample Code: Get a Taste!
Here’s a sneak peek at a pattern-printing solution:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n = 4;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
            cout << "* ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
**Output**:
```
* 
* * 
* * * 
* * * * 
```

### 🔨 Compile & Run
Got a C++ compiler (like g++)? Run this:
```
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
```
Replace `filename.cpp` with the file you want to run and `output` with your executable name.
