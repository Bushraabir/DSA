# DSA Practice Problems in C++

This repository contains my solutions to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice problems, implemented in C++. It serves as a record of my learning journey to master DSA concepts, from basic patterns to advanced algorithms, for personal growth and interview preparation.

## Overview

This repository reflects my ongoing practice of solving DSA problems to improve problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of C++. It includes solutions to problems like pattern printing, arrays, sorting, searching, and more, with a focus on clean, efficient, and optimized code.

## Repository Structure

- **Folders**: Organized by DSA topics:
  - `Patterns`: Problems involving nested loops for printing patterns (e.g., triangles, diamonds).
  - `Arrays`: Solutions for array manipulation, searching, and sorting.
  - `Others`: Additional topics like linked lists, stacks, and trees (to be added as I progress).
- **Files**: Each `.cpp` file is named after the problem or concept (e.g., `triangle_pattern.cpp`).
- **Language**: All solutions are written in C++.
## Example Code

Below is an example demonstrating nested loops in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    for (int i = 0; i <= 3; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j < 5; j++) {
            cout << j << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## How to Compile and Run

To compile and run any of the C++ files, ensure you have a C++ compiler like `g++` installed. For example:

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
```

Replace `filename.cpp` with the actual file name and `output` with your desired output executable name.


## ðŸ“Œ Features

- **Structured Codebase**: All programs are neatly categorized into folders.
- **Basic to Advanced Concepts**: Covers functions, arrays, number systems, vectors, and more.
- **Efficient Implementations**: Uses optimized algorithms and best coding practices.



## Notes

- **Personal Practice:** This repository is solely for my personal practice and learning.
- **Contributions:** Contributions and suggestions for improvements are welcome.

Happy coding! :D
